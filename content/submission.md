With this workshop, we aim to discover new ways to embrace the opportunities that semantic web technologies offer in terms of data modelling, integration, processing, and provisioning as well as in terms of developing flexible and intelligent system solutions.

We want to challenge researchers towards developing integrated description and implementation approaches through both paper submissions and interactive on-site discussion and dialog.
In particular we are looking for description approaches, formal models, implementation solutions, use cases, and applications that support a IoT solutions based on semantic web technologies.

Accepted papers will be published in workshop proceedings, for example as CEUR proceedings. 
The proceeding from last year are available under http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1783/
